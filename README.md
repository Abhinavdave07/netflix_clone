# Netflix Clone Project

Welcome to our Netflix Clone project, a collaborative effort by three members from [SGSITS](https://www.sgsits.ac.in/). This project aims to recreate the popular streaming service Netflix using HTML and CSS.

## Project Introduction

The Netflix Clone project is a web application designed to replicate the well-known Netflix user interface. As part of our college project, we've focused on honing our HTML and CSS skills while creating a visually appealing and responsive imitation of Netflix's front-end.
